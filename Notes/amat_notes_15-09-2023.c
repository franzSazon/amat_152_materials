    Byte is the fundamental unit of computer data

    When program is running, memory is kept in computer's ram.
    
    Ram is volatile which means that it is erased and replaced as often as needed.

    Variable is a named data storage location in your computers memory.
        - Computer Memory is represented by variables in computer programming.

        C Rules for creating variables:
            -Name can contain letters, digits and underscore
            - First character of the name must be a letter, underscore is also legal but not recommended
            - Case matters (numBlock is different to NumBlock)
            - C keywords cannot be used as variable namse (eg. if else then)

        Integer variables vs Float variables.
        - basically decimals vs non decimals(int)

        How to create a variable in C:
        "typename *varname;"
            Ex. int totalCost; *this creates a variable called totalCost that stores an integer

            int hoursWorked, totalWage, overtimeHours, overtimePay, hourRate; *Example of creating multiple variables in one line

            char resultLetter = "a"; *Example of assigning a variable to a specific datatype.

        int - synonymous to integer, creates an integer datatype.

        char - synonymous to character, creates a character datatype.
